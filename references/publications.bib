	abstract = {With the increasing prevalence of digital metering systems in Germany new challenges
arise. The major challenge of ensuring data protection and information security has been
addressed by the Federal O ce for Information Security ({BSI}) by introducing the Smart
Meter Gateway infrastructure. In Germany, in the near future all access to digital meters
and to connected systems ought to go through a Smart Meter Gateway ({SMGW}). This
{SMGW} provides secure channels for communication and ensures all stakeholders only receive such data they are permitted to access.
At Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems {ISE}, a decentralized energy management
system is being developed. This system aims at preventing power grid bottlenecks through
demand-side-management and thus requires access to detailed metering data.
In this paper, the access to metering data by decentralized energy management systems
under usage of the Smart Meter Gateway infrastructure is described.
{BSI} guidelines and some options of existing hard- and software solutions are considered and
evaluated. Finally, a solution for a  eld test planned at Fraunhofer {ISE} for the upcoming
year is developed and implemented in laboratory environment.},

	abstract = {A decentralized power grid control using a Swarm-Grid approach is proposed. It includes an exchange of measured data between components and a grid state estimation. Here, methods for calculating the current grid state and for generating pseudo measurements in case of non-convergence of the algorithm are proposed. Additionally, worst-case assumptions are presented which help to achieve reasonable estimates of the unknown grid voltages and currents used for the decentralized grid control. Finally the impact of unknown phase information is derived.},

	abstract = {This thesis explores the suitability of physics-aware neural networks for power quality
state estimation in distribution grids.
 For that, power quality data was generated in a
simulated environment and used for training and evaluation of different neural network
models. Comprehensive data analyses were carried out, focusing on optimal representa-
tions and processing of power quality data for neural network applications. Comparative
assessments with traditional fully connected architectures demonstrated the superior capa-
bilities of physics-aware models, which utilize the physical grid structure as a regularization
mechanism. Despite increased computational complexity, effective methods were identified
to address challenges posed by deep architectures and sparse connectivity. Best performing
models achieved a mean squared error loss of 4 × 10
−6, significantly outperforming tradi-
tional models with a loss of 1.1 × 10
−5 . The results strongly indicate that physics-aware
neural networks are suitable for power quality state estimation tasks. Promising avenues
for expanding developed models include incorporation of physical laws in the learning
process, potentially further constraining the network to physically possible states.},

	abstract = {In the transition from traditional electrical energy generation with mainly linear sources to increasing inverter-based distributed generation, electrical power systems’ power quality requires new monitoring methods. Integrating a high penetration of distributed generation, which is typically located in medium- or low-voltage grids, shifts the monitoring tasks from the transmission to distribution layers. Compared to high-voltage grids, distribution grids feature a higher level of complexity. Monitoring all relevant nodes is operationally infeasible and costly. State estimation methods provide knowledge about unmeasured locations by learning a physical system’s non-linear relationships. This article examines a new flexible, close-to-real-time concept of harmonic state estimation using synchronized measurements processed in a neural network. A physics-aware approach enhances a data-driven model, taking into account the structure of the electrical network. An {OpenDSS} simulation generates data for model training and validation. Different load profiles for both training and testing were utilized to increase the variance in the data. The results of the presented concept demonstrate high accuracy compared to other methods for harmonic orders 1 to 20.},
